A basic calculator app developed in flutter framework to carry out basic arithmetic operations

Despite the widespread use of smartphones and computer devices, many individuals still struggle with basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. As a result, they are often forced to rely on manual calculation methods, which can be time-consuming, prone to error, and simply inconvenient.

The need for a reliable and efficient calculator app that can perform these operations quickly and accurately is therefore significant. The aim of this project is to design and develop a calculator app that can perform basic arithmetic operations and provide users with accurate and immediate results, thereby increasing their productivity and reducing the likelihood of manual calculation errors
